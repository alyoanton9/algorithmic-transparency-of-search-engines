# Algorithmic Transparency on Search Engines Research

_This work is a Graduation Thesis (ITMO University)_

The main objective of this research is to devise methods that can reveal some of internal mechanisms of search engines.
More precisely, it targets the design of adversarial transparency approaches to search engines.

It is important to note that this study is experimental and introductory, and it does not pretend to reveal engines' algorithms completely.
However, the approach used may lead to further investigations in this area.
